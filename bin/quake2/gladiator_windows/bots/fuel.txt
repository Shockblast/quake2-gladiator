Description
-----------

The bot is meant to be a trainer (Ro-)bot. The comments have been
changed to be neutral and even helpful! well, not really helpful,
but entertaining :) The bot is called Fuel, because it uses the
Fuel ppm (can be found at http://deconstruct.terrafusion.com), but
any model can be used.


Installing the bot character
----------------------------

Unzip the .zip file into your Gladiator folder (using for
instance WinZIP). Don't forget to unzip the file with sub-folders.

The new bot character will automatically appear in the bot menu.

The included .cfg file can also be executed from the console to
add the new bot character directly to the game without using the
menu (type "exec bots/filename.cfg" on the console).
