Q2 Player model: Evil Ernie (http://magarn.3dpalette.com/ernie.zip)


Description
-----------

Gladiator bot character Evil Ernie, to be used with the PPM of the
same name. The model can be found at http://magarn.3dpalette.com in
the models section. Works with standard models too, but it's not
really the same thing :)


Installing the bot character
----------------------------

Unzip the .zip file into your Gladiator folder (using for
instance WinZIP). Don't forget to unzip the file with sub-folders.

The new bot character will automatically appear in the bot menu.

The included .cfg file can also be executed from the console to
add the new bot character directly to the game without using the
menu (type "exec bots/filename.cfg" on the console).
